Aim:Develop a Kotlin program for demonstrating various programming concepts.

Contents:

Store & Display Variables:
Create variables of different data types: Int, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, and String.
Display their values using println().

Type Conversion:
Convert between Int → Double, String → Int, String → Double.

Student Information Input:
Scan student details such as:
Enrollment No.
Name
Branch
Class
Batch
College Name
University
Age
Display all information.

Odd or Even Check:
Input a number and check if it is Odd or Even using control flow.

Display Month Name:
Use a when expression to display month name based on number input (1 → January, etc.).

User-Defined Functions (Arithmetic Operations):
Functions for:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Called using user input operators.

Factorial Using Recursion:
Implement recursion to calculate factorial of a given number.

Working with Arrays:
Demonstrate:
Array and IntArray
contentDeepToString()
joinToString()
Use loops: range, downTo, until
Sort array with and without built-in functions.

Maximum Number in ArrayList:
Find maximum number from an ArrayList<Int>.

Class & Constructor – Car Example:
Define a Car class with:
Type, Model, Price, Owner, Miles Driven
Implement methods:
Display Car Info
Calculate Original & Current Price

Operator Overloading – Matrix Operations:
Define a Matrix class.
Overload operators:
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
Override toString() for pretty output.

Exercises:

Swap Two Variables:
With third variable.
Without third variable.

Product & Laptop Classes:
Product as parent class.
Laptop as child class with CPU, RAM, HDD info.
Demonstrate primary & secondary constructors.
Create ArrayList of 5 laptops and display info.

Person & Student Classes:
Person as parent class.
Student as child class with Enrollment No, Branch, Class, Lab Batch.

Demonstrate constructors & inheritance.

Create ArrayList of 5 students and display info.
